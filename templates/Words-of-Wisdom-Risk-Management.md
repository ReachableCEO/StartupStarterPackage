# Risks

## Line-by-line Instructions

### Risk Map

The map is a visual summary of the risks in the detailed list. Each risk is in a cell in the risk map based on the impact and likelihood of that risk. The red cells are the most dangerous to the project, the green cells are the least dangerous. A healthy project should have almost all risks outside the red region. Any project manager who sees a risk in the red region should make an effort to move it our of the red region by lowering the likelihood of the problem occuring or reducing the potential impact.

### Risk Details

Consider how each sample risk might apply to your project. Update the position of the risk in the risk map to reflect your estimate of it likelihood and impact. Edit the risk description to fit your project.
Risks that seem likely or that would have very harmful impacts should have mitigation strategies to lower their likelihood or impact.
