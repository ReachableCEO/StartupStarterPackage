# Glossary

## Line-by-line Instructions

### Project-specific Terms

Briefly define project-specific terms. Write the definitions in enough detail that a new member of the project team could understand all the terms. Writing project-specific definitions in the glossary helps to keep other project documents short and precise while still being understandable.
The glossary document can also serve as a simple data dictionary.
