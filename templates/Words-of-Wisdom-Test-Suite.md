# Test Suite

## Line-by-line Instructions

### Test Cases by Business Object and Operation

The advantage of this test case organization is that it visualizes the overall set of tests in a way that helps identify missing tests.

### Detailed Test Case Grid(s)

Use this sub-grid to visually organize the set of tests that would fit into a single table cell in the main test grid. This level of detail helps to visualize whether all possible situations are covered. I.e., are all relevant classes of input values covered? and are all relevant system states covered?

### Test Cases by Feature Priority

This test suite visualization is useful for understanding how well specific features are being covered by the system test suite in this release. It is not uncommon to focus testing effort on the highest priority features, or the most risky features, first.

### Test Cases by Use Case Priority

This visualization helps show which use cases are being covered by the system test suite. It is not unusual to focus on testing high priority use cases first.
