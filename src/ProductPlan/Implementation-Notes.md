**Process impact:** This document is a brief and fairly technical
discussion of how the system works under ideal conditions. It is also
known as a "theory of operation" document. It should describe key
algorithms, technology dependencies, and operational issues. Much of the
content of this document can be drawn from design documents. This
document will be used by the QA, technical support, and operations
groups. The goal is to give those groups the information they need to
understand, manage, or begin to troubleshoot the system (i.e., recognize
certain behavior as normal or abnormal). If significantly more
information is needed, it should be organized into a larger "operations
guide".

### Type of Implementation

_TODO: Fill in information that will help other engineers understand this
system at-a-glance. Feel free to use relevant technical terms and name
specific technology platforms._

#### Type of system

- ::Desktop GUI application ||
- ::Unix-style command ||
- ::Server-side web application ||
- ::Web service ||
- ::Client-side applet ||
- ::Embedded application ||
- ::Reusable library ||
- ::Reusable class framework ||
- ::Browser Plug-in

#### Programming Language(s)

- ::Java ||
- ::Perl, Unix shell scripts

#### Data Storage

- ::Flat files using XML ||
- ::Flat files using Java properties file format ||
- ::Flat files using Java object serialization format ||
- ::SQL database: MySQL

#### UI Technologies

- ::Java Swing ||
- ::XHTML, CSS, JavaScript

##### Security Technologies

- ::Authentication: None needed ||
- ::Authentication: Local username and password file ||
- ::Authentication: LDAP ||
- ::Authorization: Operating system file ownership and read-write-execute flags ||
- ::Authorization: Access control lists ||
- ::Encryption: None needed ||
- ::Encryption: SSL

### Runtime Environment

_TODO: List and describe runtime objects that make up a running system.
These objects may be referred to by name in the sections below._

#### Processes

- ::Main application process
- ::Client and server processes
- ::Cron tasks
- ::Operating system services or drivers

#### Configuration Files

- ::PRODUCT-NAME.conf: stores application configuration in Java properties file format.
- ::Section of httpd.conf: configures components of the Apache webserver

#### Database Table

- ::TABLE_ONE: Each row represents a ...
- ::TABLE_TWO: Each row represents a ...
- ::TABLE_THREE: Each row represents a ...
- ::See the persistence design document.

#### Data Files

- ::\*.ext: Data files saved by the user on their local hard disk.
- ::/var/PRODUCT-NAME/upload-XXXX.dat: Files uploaded to the server.

#### Temporary Files

- ::/tmp/PRODUCT-NAME.pid: Process ID of the currently running server process.
- ::/tmp/upload-XXXX.dat: Files uploaded to the server before they are processed.

#### Log Files

- ::error.log: Serious errors are put in the normal Apache error log. Must be writable by Unix user httpd.
- ::PRODUCT-NAME.log: Messages indicating the progress of normal operations and some errors. Must be writable by Unix user httpd.
- ::Log files are rotated nightly. Old logs are archived in ANOTHER LOCATION.

### Implementation of Specific Features

_TODO: Write short descriptions of interesting or unexpected algorithms,
limiting assumptions, or any other implementation detail that will
impact the work of other groups. E.g., long-running operations that must
not be interrupted. E.g., start up or shutdown scripts that are
automatically run by the operating system._

### Operational Procedures

_TODO: Briefly describe procedures that should be followed by operations
engineers when the system is being run in an ASP production environment._

#### Install

::See the [installation guide](Installation-Guide)

#### Upgrade

::See the [installation guide](Installation-Guide)

#### Start Server

1. ::STEP 1
2. ::STEP 2
3. ::STEP 3

#### Stop Server

1. ::STEP 1
2. ::STEP 2
3. ::STEP 3

#### Reload Config Files

1. ::STEP 1
2. ::STEP 2
3. ::STEP 3

#### Monitor Activity

::Watch the PRODUCT-NAME.log and error.log.

#### Periodic Cleanup

::On rare occasion, /tmp/upload-XXXX.dat files can be left behind. Any such files that are more than a day old can safely be removed.

### Security

_TODO: Write notes on security to help operations engineers keep the
system secure while it is in operation._

We take the following precautions to make the system secure

- ::STEP
- ::STEP
- ::STEP

The security of the system depends on the following external factors

### Performance and Scalability

_TODO: Write notes on performance and scalability to help operations
engineers operate the system efficiently._

::NOTES ON PERFORMANCE.

::NOTES ON SCALABILITY.

### Implementation Notes Checklist

Do these implementation notes provide enough information for operations engineers?

- ::Yes, these notes have been reviewed by the operations team and
  requested changes have been incorporated.
- ::No, these notes only summarize parts of a larger
  [operations manual](LINK-TO-OPERATIONS-MANUAL).
- ::No, a member of the development team is available on-call whenever
  the operations team may need help. This is listed in the
  [Resource Needs](Resource-Needs) document and in the
  [on-call schedule](LINK-TO-ON-CALL-SCHEDULE).

Have these implementation notes been communicated to the operations and development teams and other stakeholders?

- ::Yes, everyone has had a chance to review them. Feedback is welcome.
- ::Yes, it has been posted to the project website.
- ::No, some developers or operations engineers are not aware of
  this document. This is a risk that is noted in the
  [Risk Management](Project-Plan#risk-management) section of the
  [Project Plan](Project-Plan).
