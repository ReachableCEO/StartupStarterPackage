# Project Overview

## Line-by-line Instructions

### What business problem does this project address?

Use 2-4 sentences to describe the problem that your potential users are having right now. Focus on business problems, not technical problems. If you are trying to solve a technical problem, describe the business need that makes that technical problem important enough to solve. Do not say anything about your solution here.

### What is the goal of this project?

Write 2-4 sentences or bullets on your main goal for the project. Briefly, name your target audience and mention key benefits that your customers will gain by using your product.

### What is the scope of this project?

Give 2-4 sentences or bullets that summarize what you intend to do as part of this project. A good scope paragraph helps you avoid feature creep later.

### Status

Briefly indicate what the team has recently accomplished and what they will do next. Write the details in the status reports, not here.

Customization: If you do not want to use status report documents, you can select some parts of the status report template and paste them here in the "Status" section of the all-in-one template.

### Development Documents

These are simply links to all the development documents. Feel free to add more links, or remove links that you are not using.
