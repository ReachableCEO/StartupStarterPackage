## Line-by-line Instructions

### Questions and Answers

The goal of the FAQ is to minimize technical support calls. The set of questions and answers ultimately must be driven by the actual questions and concerns of users. You can anticipate questions ahead of time based on your knowledge of the product and the sample text in the template. Long FAQ's with dozens of questions and answers are definitely usable, so long as the questions and answers are organized into logical sections.
