**Process impact:**

This design document describes a system that will satisfy the requirements of the [SRS](SRS). Decisions made in creating this design document are based on those requirements and an understanding of available technologies and components. Once the design has been drafted, work on the system implementation and unit testing may begin.

_TODO: Fill in the sections below. Add ore remove items as needed for your project._
