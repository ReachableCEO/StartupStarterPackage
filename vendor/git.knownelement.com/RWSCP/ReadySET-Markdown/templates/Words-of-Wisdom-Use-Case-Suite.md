# Use Case Suite

## Line-by-line Instructions

### Use Cases by Feature Area

This organization of the use case suite is useful because it visually shows coverage of the set of features. Any feature area that is too few use cases may be under-specified and need more work to fully specify it.

### Use Cases by Stakeholder

This organization of the use case helps to make sure that you have understood the needs of all classes stakeholders and users. If there is any class of user that doe not have as many use cases as you feel are needed, you can clearly see that and realize that you must add more use cases.

### Use Cases by Priority

This use case suite organization highlights the most important use cases for this release. Development, documentation, and quality assurance efforts could be focused on these use cases.

### Use Cases by Business Object and Actor

This grid organization helps you to visually recognize missing use cases. For each cell in the table, ask youself "what does user X do with business object Y?". If the answer is "nothing", then write "N/A". If the answer is something, note down the names of some use cases. If the user does do something with that business object, but you don't know what that is, write "TODO" as a reminder to come back to that cell.
